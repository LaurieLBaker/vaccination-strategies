- Only two infectious diseases have been eliminated worldwide: small pox and rinderpest.

- Mass vaccination can greatly reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. 

- However, it is unclear how long vaccination programs must operate to eliminate infection. 

- In this talk I am going to explore two different vaccination strategies applied to fox rabies and Covid-19.

???

This figure shows the probability of elimination and ranked importance of campaigns across epidemiological scenarios. Left panels show the probability of elimination from all five regions in response to incremental vaccination (mean, and shaded 95% CI). (a) In the endemic scenario, 21 campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions. (b) In the high-risk scenario, 19 campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions, with vaccination of the endemic regions ranked first, and vaccination after the birth pulse (months 56 and 68) contributing most to the probability of elimination. A minimum of two or three campaigns was required in neighbouring rabies-free regions. (c) In the endgame scenario, nine campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions.


What we can see from these results is that:

1. Similar effort is required in high-risk and endemic, even though fewer regions were initially infected. 


2. Autumn campaigns were ranked highest and resulted in the greatest reductions in rabies because they come after the birth pulse. 

3. Vaccination needed in rabies-free regions. Because rabies moves across borders, vaccination is still required in neighbouring regions.

## Financial barriers?

## Social and Cultural barriers?

???
Remote sensing and other open data sets can help to approximate health accessibility in a "physical sense". 

But if we define accessibility only in terms of physical distances, what are we missing?

The extent to which a population 'gains access' also depends on financial, organisational and social or cultural barriers that limit the use of services.


The people who are best placed to answer these questions and devise a strategy are the communities and healthworkers with local knowledge who are closest to the issues and the community.

Computer science and data science can provide us with the tools to tackle complex issues. But we bring the knowledge, the context, and importantly the human experience and perspectives to make our work meaningful and equitable. 

Data is always a simplification of the human experience and it is important that in our data science projects we ask the questions like those set out by Catherine D'Ingazio and Lauren Klein: "Data Science By Whom"? "Data Science For Whom?"?, "Data Science with whose interests in mind?" 

We also need to value local knowledge and support communities in finding their own solutions to questions.

???

I also looked at what happens when things go wrong and we miss campaigns.

* We found that consecutive and coordinated vaccination across geographical regions is required to rapidly control and eliminate rabies

* Incomplete vaccination (missing campaign sets) compromised time to elimination, with the same or more effort required to achieve elimination and meet similar timelines. 

- It is, therefore, important that policymakers commit to the full elimination timeline and strive to maintain comprehensive coverage to eliminate persistent foci and prevent further costs.
