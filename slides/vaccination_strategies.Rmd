In this talk I'm going to talk about two very different vaccination contexts: vaccination planning for a wildlife disease. 

---
# Background

* Only two diseases have been eliminated worldwide: small pox and rinderpest.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1050, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Patient's leg with small pox. Cattle that have died from rinderpest"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/small_pox_rinderpest.PNG")

```



* Mass vaccination can greatly reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases.

* However it is unclear how long vaccination must operate to eliminate infection.

# Rabies

* Rabies is a deadly disease that kills over 59,000 people each year.
* An RNA lyssavirus that causes encephalitis in a large range of mammals.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=750, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Map of the world with main rabies animal hosts pictured."}

# Foxes

* Most widespread terrestrial carnivore in Europe
* Territorial with high population turnover: 
  * Most foxes live on average 4 years. 
  * Large birth pulse where the population doubles. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=750, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Rabies cycle in foxes."}

* Over 2.36 million sq. km vaccinated
* Equivalent to 550,000 soccer fields

Over three decades, vaccine loaded chicken-heads were air-dropped across Europe covering a total of 2.36 million square kilometers, the equivalent of 550,000 soccer fields.

???

* Consecutive and coordinated vaccination is required to rapidly control and eliminate rabies.

* Missing Campaigns

Overall we recommend (i) prioritizing ORV campaign sets following the birth pulse, i.e. in autumn, if resources are limited; (ii) 

* Implementing consecutive vaccination campaign sets to build up and sustain high levels of herd immunity;

By contrast, incomplete vaccination (missing campaign sets) compromised time to elimination, with the same or more effort required to achieve elimination and meet similar timelines. It is, therefore, important that policymakers commit to the full elimination timeline and strive to maintain comprehensive coverage to eliminate persistent foci and prevent further costs.
We found that consecutive and coordinated vaccination across geographical regions is required to rapidly control and eliminate rabies

Open and up-to-date data is crucial to plan these efforts. With afrimapr we've been working closely with healthsites.io and other open mapping efforts to gather and visualise the data that is needed.

Travel Time in minutes
???
Remote sensing and other open data sets can help to approximate health accessibility in a "physical sense". 

But there are other complex and social economic factors that we are often missing.

The people who are best placed to answer these questions and devise a strategy are those communities who are closest to the issue.

- Work with students at intersection of different topics
- And on important issues in Maine.
